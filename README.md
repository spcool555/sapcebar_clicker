<h1>Spacebar Counter</h1>

A spacebar counter with a set timer is an online tool that allows you to count the number of times you can press the spacebar key on your keyboard within a specified time frame. You can set the timer for a specific amount of time, such as 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or one minute, and then start the test. The tool will then record the number of times you press the spacebar within the set time frame and display the results once the time is up.
